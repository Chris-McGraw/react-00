# React Drum Machine

An interactive drum machine built from the ground up with ReactJS. Users can create, save, edit, and playback custom audio loops using different collections of samples and controllable effect levels. Connected to the native Javascript Web Audio API for audio processing with high precision/low latency timing control.

Currently optimized for desktop Chrome and mobile iOS* browsers.

*For mobile iOS, Modern WebAudio API must be turned on in advanced Safari settings and silent mode must be disabled.
